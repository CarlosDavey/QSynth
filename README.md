Portfolio of Qsynth experimental plugin. 


This plugin aims to emulate quantum wave packet interaction as an enveloper for a basic synthesizer. The results are not yet fully developed, however the idea and implementation are still of interest 
I would like to revisit this idea in the future as I believe the core concept is very interesting.
